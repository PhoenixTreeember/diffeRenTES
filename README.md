#diffeRenTES
A script written in R for calculating TES (Threshold Ergodic Sets) based differentiation tree starting from Boolean networks.

The mathematical model of differentiation based on TES on which these functions are built was firstly described in "A Dynamical Model of Genetic Networks for Cell Differentiation"
