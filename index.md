# What is it??
*diffeRenTES* (from French various, different, separate) is a package written in R for calculating TESs (Threshold Ergodic Sets) based differentiation tree starting from Boolean networks.

TESs are the mathematical abstractions with which a powerful model of differentiation represents the different cell types that are generated during a process of differentiation.
The aforementioned model of differentiation based on Boolean networks is firstly described in *"A Dynamical Model of Genetic Networks for Cell Differentiation" Villani M, Barbieri A, Serra R (2011) A Dynamical Model of Genetic Networks for Cell Differentiation. PLOS ONE 6(3): e17703. <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017703>*
